Originally Xperl 1.9.6 , but forked and improved

Additional features: 

- Backported rare/elite NPC target frames from newer xperl version
- Added player pet frame width option
- Hides XP bar if max level and no reputation is tracked (instead of having xp bar with text "none watched")
- Frequent XP updates for seeing rested progress when staying under a tent
